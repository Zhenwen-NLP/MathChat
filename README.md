Official code and data repository of MathChat: MathChat: Benchmarking Mathematical Reasoning and Instruction Following in Multi-Turn Interactions

Welcome to the repository! This directory contains four JSONL files in our proposed MathChat benchmark:

First part is the benchmark files:

## File Descriptions

### 1. follow_up.jsonl
This file contains entries that facilitate follow-up questioning. Each line consists of three keys:
- **question**: Sourced from the GSM8k testing set.
- **answer**: Corresponding answer from the GSM8k testing set.
- **followup**: Includes two rounds of follow-up questions and reference answers, formatted as a conversation between a user (A:) and an assistant (B:).

### 2. error_correction.jsonl
This file is designed for error correction tasks. Each line consists of three keys:
- **question**: Sourced from the GSM8k testing set.
- **answer**: Corresponding answer from the GSM8k testing set.
- **error_correction**: Contains a conversation between a user (A:) and an assistant (B:), which includes the original question, an incorrect answer, and the process of correcting the error.

### 3. error_analysis.jsonl
This file also focuses on error correction but employs a different prompt strategy. Each line consists of three keys:
- **question**: Sourced from the GSM8k testing set.
- **answer**: Corresponding answer from the GSM8k testing set.
- **error_analysis**: Includes a conversation between a user (A:) and an assistant (B:), where the model is prompted to independently determine the correctness of the answer without being explicitly told.

### 4. p2p_generation.jsonl
This file contains entries for problem generation tasks. Each line consists of three keys:
- **question**: Sourced from the GSM8k testing set.
- **answer**: Corresponding answer from the GSM8k testing set.
- **new_problem**: A new problem generated by GPT-4 to serve as a reference answer.

Second part is the MathChat_sync dataset that can be used to fine-tune your own LLMs. 

Due to the large size of the dataset, we put the file on this google drive:

We hope these files aid in your analysis and development efforts. For any questions or contributions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Happy coding!
